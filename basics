A user agent is a “string” – that is, a line of text – identifying the browser and operating system to the web server. 
When your browser connects to a website, it includes a User-Agent field in its HTTP header. 
The contents of the user agent field vary from browser to browser. Each browser has its own, distinctive user agent. 
Essentially, a user agent is a way for a browser to say “Hi, I’m Mozilla Firefox on Windows” or “Hi, I’m Safari"
The web server can use this information to serve different web pages to different web browsers and different operating systems.
For example, a website could send mobile pages to mobile browsers
